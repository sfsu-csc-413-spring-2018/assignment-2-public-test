## Testing Script for Assignment 2

This script just shows you *how* we're testing - it does not include all of the test
cases we will be using, so you should be certain that you are testing for valid cases
as well as failure cases.

### Instructions

Clone this repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:sfsu-csc-413-spring-2018/assignment-2-public-test.git
```

Change directory into the cloned repository:
```
cd assignment-2-public-test
```

Now, clone *your assignment's repository* into this directory (using your repo's address):
```
git clone git@github.com:sfsu-csc-413-spring-2018/assignment-2-me.git
```

You will now be able to execute the script (assuming you can execute shell scripts):
```
./testing_script.sh
```

You should see the following if your project passed the test:
```
